# YCSB Adaptation Instruction

[toc]

# Background

YCSB contains its core component (ycsb/core) and adaptors for each different storage system, e.g., redis, rocksdb, etc. The core component is unaware of the APIs of each different system. It implements an abstraction layer of I/O APIs on top of the adaptor and generates generic I/O workloads according to the configuration file. The adaptors implement generic I/O APIs with the APIs of the storage system. For example, the adaptor of redis, ```ycsb-master/redis/src/main/java/site/ycsb/db/RedisClient.java```, implements APIs such as read and insert by calling the jedis APIs.

# Adaptor for Your Storsage Tier

To run CDSben on the storage tier of your cloud-native database system, it is essential that you implement a corresponding adaptor.

# YCSB-core Adaptation

There are two main adaptations. First, we have to modify how YCSB generates I/O requests. Second, we have to modify how YCSB executes requests.

## Request Generation in YCSB

As we discussed in our paper, the adapted YCSB loads the generated I/O requests for sequential execution. To implement this feature, we have to bypass the process of reading configuration files and generating I/O requests according to the configuration file in YCSB-core.

In ```YCSB-master/core/src/main/java/site/ycsb/Client.java``` line 302, it loads a ```Workload``` object which is used to control the I/O workload generation. In YCSB, a threadpool containing multiple threads are used to generate and execute I/O requests. All the client threads in the threadpool share the ```Workload``` object. They call ```doTransaction``` API in the ```Workload``` object to determine which request to execute next. To bypass this process, first, in ```YCSB-master/core/src/main/java/site/ycsb/Client.java#main```, we can add source code between line 302 and line 304 to load the I/O requests into YCSB. Then, after line 312, where the client threads are initialized, we assign each client thread a queue of requests this client should execute. The way we assign requests to client threads could be round-robin.
```java
    //...
    // The next line is line 302.
    Workload workload = getWorkload(props);
    // Add code here to load the I/O requests.
    final Tracer tracer = getTracer(props, workload);

    initWorkload(props, warningthread, workload, tracer);

    System.err.println("Starting test.");
    final CountDownLatch completeLatch = new CountDownLatch(threadcount);

    final List<ClientThread> clients = initDb(dbname, props, threadcount, targetperthreadperms,
        workload, tracer, completeLatch);
    // Add code here to assign each client thread a queue of requests to execute.
    // ...
```
Then, in ```YCSB-master/core/src/main/java/site/ycsb/ClientThread.java#run```, from line 122 to line 124, instead of letting the ```Workload``` determine what request to execute next, the client thread executes the next request in its request queue.
```java
          //...
          // The next line is line 122. Load the next request from the queue.
          if (!workload.doTransaction(db, workloadstate)) {
            break;
          }
          //...
```

## Request Execution in YCSB

In YCSB, the I/O requests are issued in a constant speed. However, to execute I/O requests with burstiness, the adapted YCSB must be able to issue I/O requests with different intensity each second. In the loaded requests, each request comes with a timestamp indicates when it should be executed, and we modify YCSB to execute I/O requests according to this timestamp. In ```YCSB-master/core/src/main/java/site/ycsb/ClientThread.java#run``` line 128, YCSB implements its control of intensity. We replace it and insert before line 122 to sleep until it is time to execute the next I/O request.
```java
        //...
        // The next line is line 120.
        while (((opcount == 0) || (opsdone < opcount)) && !workload.isStopRequested()) {
          // Load the next request and sleep until it is time to execute the loaded request.
          if (!workload.doTransaction(db, workloadstate)) {
            break;
          }

          opsdone++;
          // Remove the next line.
          throttleNanos(startTimeNanos);
        }
        //...
```
